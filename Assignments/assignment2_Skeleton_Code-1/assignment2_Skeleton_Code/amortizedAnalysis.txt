1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array?
    ANSWER: 97 units of cost are spent in the entire process. 

As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?
    ANSWER: The average big-oh complexity for a push is O(1)+ as N grows larger
        

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic
array? 
    ANSWER: 408 units of cost are spent in the entire process.

As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?
    ANSWER: The average big-oh comolexity for a push is O(n/2) as N grows larger.
