How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? 

    ANSWER: 96 cost units spent in the entire process.

As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?
    
    ANSWER: O(1)+

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic
array? 

    ANSWER: 408 cost units spent in the entire process.

As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a
push?

    ANSWER:  O(n/2)
